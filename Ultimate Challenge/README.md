# Take-home Interview Challenge: Ultimate Technologies Inc.
The neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis have complementary circadian rhythms: on weekdays, Ultimate Gotham is most active at night, and Ultimate Metropolis is most active during the day. On weekends, there is reasonable activity in both cities. 

However, a toll bridge, with a two way toll, between the two cities causes driver partners to tend to be exclusive to each city. The Ultimate managers of city operations for the two cities have proposed an experiment to encourage driver partners to be available in both cities, by reimbursing all toll costs.

Ultimate Technologies Inc. would like to use these datasets to understand what factors are the best predictors for rider retention, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help Ultimate. To do so, sample data from driver partners (a.k.a. taxi drivers, Uber drivers, etc.) are used to understand the behavior of the riders they transport.
